Fluent API to call the FHIR server that handles:

1. Authentication to FHIR server
2. Renewing access token when they expire
3. Retry when there are transient errors
4. Un-bundling the resources received from FHIR server
5. Paging
6. Streaming
7. Logging
8. Simulating a $graph call when the server does not support it


# Usage
`pip install helix.fhir.client.sdk`

# Asynchronous Support
When communicating with FHIR servers, a lot of time is spent waiting for the server to respond. 
This is a good use case for using asynchronous programming. 
This SDK supports asynchronous programming using the `async` and `await` keywords.

The return types are Python AsyncGenerators.  Python makes it very easy to work with AsyncGenerators.

For example, if the SDK provides a function like this:
```python

async def get_resources(self) -> AsyncGenerator[FhirGetResponse, None]:
    ...
```

You can iterate over the results as they become available:
```python
response: Optional[FhirGetResponse]
async for response in client.get_resources():
    print(response.resource)
```

Or you can get a list of responses (which will return AFTER all the responses are received:
```python

responses: List[FhirGetResponse] = [response async for response in client.get_resources()]
```

Or you can aggregate the responses into one response (which will return AFTER all the responses are received:
```python

response: Optional[FhirGetResponse] = await FhirGetResponse.from_async_generator(client.get_resources())
```

# Data Streaming
For FHIR servers that support data streaming (e.g., b.well FHIR server), you can just set the `use_data_streaming` parameter to stream the data as it i received.
The data will be streamed in AsyncGenerators as described above.
